# Machine-Learning

House price prediction is a crucial task in real estate and mortgage lending, as it helps stakeholders make informed decisions. XGBoost, a powerful machine learning algorithm, is often used for this purpose due to its high performance and accuracy.

<h2>Key Points:</h2>
<b>Data Preparation:</b> The process begins with collecting and cleaning data, which typically includes features like the size of the house, number of rooms, location, and other relevant attributes.<br>
<b>Data Preparation:</b>x This step involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the model’s performance. For example, combining latitude and longitude to create a location feature.<br>
<b>Model Training:</b> XGBoost is trained on the prepared dataset. It uses gradient boosting, which builds an ensemble of trees sequentially, each one correcting the errors of the previous ones.<br>
<b>Hyperparameter Tuning:</b> Adjusting parameters like learning rate, max depth, and number of estimators to optimize the model’s performance.<br>
<b>Model Evaluation:</b> The model’s accuracy is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). XGBoost often outperforms other algorithms in these evaluations12.<br>
<h2>Benefits:</h2><br>
<b>High Accuracy: </b>XGBoost’s ability to handle large datasets and complex relationships makes it highly accurate for predicting house prices.<br>
<b>Feature Importance:</b> It provides insights into which features are most influential in determining house prices, aiding better decision-making.<br>
<b>Scalability:</b> XGBoost can efficiently handle large datasets, making it suitable for real-world applications.
